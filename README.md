# well-pad-denver-permian
Public repository for "Deep learning for detecting and characterizing oil and gas well pads in satellite imagery."

This repository contains: 
1. Datasets used to train well pad and storage tank detection models.
2. Well pad and storage tank deployment detections across the entire Permian and Denver basins generated in this study.
3. Results of experiments on test sets from 1. and evaluation code (`code/eval_test.py`) for replicating performance metrics (i.e., Tables 1 and 4 in the paper).
4. Evaluation code (`code/eval_deployment.py`) for comparing deployment detections to reported HIFLD well pad data (i.e. Fig. 2 in the paper).
